# NotationEditor Component Documentation

## Overview

The `NotationEditor` component is a React-based music notation editor that allows users to create, play, and export musical scores. It's part of a larger project that appears to be a music composition and collaboration tool. This component specifically handles the creation and manipulation of musical notation.

## File Location

`src/components/NotationEditor.js`

## Dependencies

- React
- Tone.js
- VexFlow
- @tonejs/midi
- Chakra UI components

## Component Structure

The `NotationEditor` is a functional component that uses React hooks for state management and side effects.

## State Variables

- `notes`: Array of note objects representing the current score
- `currentOctave`: Current octave for new notes (default: 4)
- `currentDuration`: Current duration for new notes (default: 'q' for quarter note)
- `timeSignature`: Current time signature (default: '4/4')
- `bpm`: Beats per minute (default: 120)
- `isPlaying`: Boolean indicating if the score is currently playing

## Refs

- `rendererRef`: Reference to the VexFlow renderer
- `contextRef`: Reference to the VexFlow context
- `staveRef`: Reference to the VexFlow stave
- `synthRef`: Reference to the Tone.js synthesizer

## Main Functions

### `addNote(noteName)`

Adds a new note to the score.

Parameters:
- `noteName`: String representing the note name (e.g., 'C', 'D', 'E', etc.)

### `playNotes()`

Plays the current score using Tone.js.

### `clearNotes()`

Clears all notes from the score.

### `exportMIDI()`

Exports the current score as a MIDI file.

## useEffect Hooks

1. Initial setup of VexFlow renderer, context, and stave.
2. Re-render notation when notes change.

## UI Components

The component renders:
- A staff for displaying notation
- Buttons for adding notes
- Dropdowns for selecting octave, note duration, and time signature
- Input for BPM
- Buttons for playing, clearing, and exporting the score

## Usage Example

```jsx
import NotationEditor from './components/NotationEditor';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <NotationEditor />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Notes

- The component uses Chakra UI for styling and layout.
- It integrates VexFlow for rendering music notation.
- Tone.js is used for audio playback.
- MIDI export functionality is implemented using @tonejs/midi.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more complex notations (e.g., chords, articulations)
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add ability to save and load scores

This component plays a crucial role in the music composition aspect of the project, allowing users to create and interact with musical notation directly in the browser.
