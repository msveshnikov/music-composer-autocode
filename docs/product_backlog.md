Based on the current project state and recent developments, here's an updated product backlog:

# Updated Product Backlog

## High Priority

1. Fix play button functionality
   - Resolve issues with the play button across all components
   - Ensure consistent behavior and prevent endless playback loops

2. Implement MIDI export
   - Add functionality to export compositions as MIDI files
   - Ensure compatibility with various digital audio workstations (DAWs)

3. Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Improve layout and usability on mobile devices
   - Optimize touch interactions for composition on smaller screens

4. Implement basic notation editor
   - Create a user-friendly interface for inputting and editing musical notation
   - Integrate with Web Audio API for real-time playback

5. Integrate virtual instrument sounds
   - Implement a basic library of virtual instruments
   - Allow users to select and play instruments within the notation editor

## Medium Priority

6. Develop chord progression generator
   - Create an algorithm to suggest chord progressions based on user input or selected genre

7. Implement audio export functionality
   - Allow users to export their compositions as audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV)

8. Add dark mode support
   - Implement a toggle for dark mode to reduce eye strain during long composition sessions

9. Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback
   - Conduct user testing and implement improvements based on feedback

10. Implement offline mode and local storage
    - Allow users to compose and edit without an internet connection
    - Implement local storage to save work in progress

## Low Priority

11. Develop melody suggestion tool
    - Create an AI-powered tool to suggest melodies based on chord progressions or user preferences

12. Add support for custom instrument samples
    - Allow users to upload and use their own instrument samples

13. Implement version control for compositions
    - Allow users to view and revert to previous versions of their work

14. Integrate with music education resources
    - Provide links or embedded tutorials to help users improve their composition skills

## Completed Items

- ~~Set up basic project structure~~
- ~~Create README.md with project overview~~
- ~~Initialize React.js application~~
- ~~Develop responsive design~~ (Now focusing on enhancing mobile responsiveness)

## Additional Notes

- The real-time collaboration feature remains deprioritized as we focus on core functionality and stability.
- We should implement automated testing alongside new feature development to ensure application stability.
- User authentication and profile management should be considered for the next iteration of the backlog to support personalized experiences and saved compositions.
- Performance optimization, especially for complex compositions, should be an ongoing consideration throughout development.
- Accessibility features should be integrated into the development process to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.

This updated backlog reflects the immediate needs identified in the TODO list, while maintaining focus on core composition functionality. The highest priorities now include fixing critical issues with playback and export, as well as improving mobile usability. We've adjusted the order of some existing items and added new features based on the project's current state and potential user needs.
