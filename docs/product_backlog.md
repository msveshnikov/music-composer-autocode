Based on the current project state and recent developments, here's an updated product backlog:

# Updated Product Backlog

## High Priority

1. Implement basic notation editor
   - Create a user-friendly interface for inputting and editing musical notation
   - Integrate with Web Audio API for real-time playback

2. Integrate virtual instrument sounds
   - Implement a basic library of virtual instruments
   - Allow users to select and play instruments within the notation editor

3. Develop responsive design
   - Ensure the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Implement a fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## Medium Priority

4. Implement audio export functionality
   - Allow users to export their compositions as audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV)

5. Develop chord progression generator
   - Create an algorithm to suggest chord progressions based on user input or selected genre

6. Add dark mode support
   - Implement a toggle for dark mode to reduce eye strain during long composition sessions

7. Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback
   - Conduct user testing and implement improvements based on feedback

## Low Priority

8. Implement offline mode and local storage
   - Allow users to compose and edit without an internet connection
   - Implement local storage to save work in progress

9. Develop melody suggestion tool
   - Create an AI-powered tool to suggest melodies based on chord progressions or user preferences

10. Add support for custom instrument samples
    - Allow users to upload and use their own instrument samples

## Completed Items

- ~~Set up basic project structure~~
- ~~Create README.md with project overview~~
- ~~Initialize React.js application~~

## Additional Notes

- The real-time collaboration feature has been deprioritized for now, as we want to focus on core composition functionality first.
- We should consider adding automated testing to ensure the stability of the application as we develop new features.
- User authentication and profile management may need to be added to the backlog in the future to support personalized experiences and saved compositions.

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project and prioritizes the core functionality of the music composition site. The focus is on creating a solid foundation with the notation editor and virtual instruments before moving on to more advanced features.
