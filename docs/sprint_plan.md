Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Improve core functionality and user experience by fixing critical playback issues, implementing
basic MIDI export, and enhancing mobile responsiveness.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks

### High Priority

1. Fix play button functionality (8 points)

    - Resolve issues with the play button across all components
    - Ensure consistent behavior and prevent endless playback loops

2. Implement basic MIDI export (5 points)

    - Add functionality to export compositions as MIDI files
    - Ensure compatibility with common digital audio workstations (DAWs)

3. Enhance mobile responsiveness (8 points)

    - Improve layout and usability on mobile devices
    - Optimize touch interactions for composition on smaller screens

4. Implement basic notation editor (13 points)
    - Create a user-friendly interface for inputting and editing musical notation
    - Integrate with Web Audio API for real-time playback

### Medium Priority

5. Integrate virtual instrument sounds (8 points)

    - Implement a basic library of virtual instruments
    - Allow users to select and play instruments within the notation editor

6. Add dark mode support (3 points)

    - Implement a toggle for dark mode to reduce eye strain during long composition sessions

7. Implement offline mode and local storage (5 points)
    - Allow users to compose and edit without an internet connection
    - Implement local storage to save work in progress

## Effort Estimates

Total Story Points: 50

## Dependencies and Risks

-   The notation editor implementation (Task 4) is a prerequisite for MIDI export (Task 2)
-   Virtual instrument integration (Task 5) depends on the basic notation editor (Task 4)
-   Offline mode (Task 7) may require additional testing to ensure data integrity across
    online/offline states
-   Mobile responsiveness (Task 3) may reveal unforeseen challenges in the current UI design
-   Fixing the play button (Task 1) may uncover deeper issues in the audio playback system

## Definition of Done

-   All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch
-   Unit tests are written and passing for new features
-   Features are tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet,
    mobile)
-   Documentation is updated to reflect new features and changes
-   UI/UX designs are implemented and responsive across all target devices
-   Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets for each feature
-   Accessibility standards are met for all new UI elements
-   All selected tasks have been completed and meet their individual acceptance criteria
-   The product owner has reviewed and approved the implemented features

This sprint plan focuses on addressing the critical issues identified in the TODO list while also
making progress on core functionality. The high-priority items aim to stabilize the application and
improve its usability, especially on mobile devices. The medium-priority items will enhance the user
experience and add valuable features like offline support and dark mode. The team should be prepared
to adjust priorities if unexpected challenges arise during the sprint, particularly with the play
button fix and mobile responsiveness enhancements.
