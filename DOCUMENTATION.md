## Project Overview

The Music Composition Site is a web-based platform designed to provide tools and resources for
musicians and composers. It aims to simplify the music composition process by offering an
interactive interface with various features such as a notation editor, virtual instrument library,
chord progression generator, and melody suggestion tool.

**Demo:** [https://music-composer.netlify.app/](https://music-composer.netlify.app/)

## Architecture

The project is built using a modern web technology stack:

-   **Frontend:** React.js
-   **Routing:** react-router-dom v6
-   **Audio Processing:** Web Audio API
-   **Sound Synthesis:** Tone.js
-   **Music Notation:** VexFlow

The architecture follows a component-based structure, emphasizing modularity and scalability. Key
architectural decisions include:

1. Responsive design for cross-device compatibility
2. Modular component structure for maintainability
3. Scalable architecture to support future feature additions
4. Optimized performance for handling complex musical data
5. Accessibility features for users with disabilities
6. Dark mode support
7. Offline mode capabilities

## Features

1. **Interactive Music Notation Editor:** Allows users to create and edit musical scores directly in
   the browser.
2. **Virtual Instrument Library:** Provides a wide range of instrument sounds for composition and
   playback.
3. **Chord Progression Generator:** Assists users in creating harmonically sound chord progressions.
4. **Melody Suggestion Tool:** Offers melodic ideas based on the current composition context.
5. **Real-time Collaboration:** Enables multiple users to work on a composition simultaneously.
6. **Audio Playback and Export:** Allows users to listen to their compositions and export them in
   various formats.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-composition-site.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd music-composition-site
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

After starting the development server, open your web browser and navigate to
`http://localhost:3000`. You'll be presented with the main interface of the Music Composition Site.
From here, you can:

-   Use the notation editor to create and edit musical scores
-   Access the virtual instrument library to add sounds to your composition
-   Generate chord progressions using the chord progression tool
-   Get melody suggestions based on your current composition
-   Collaborate with other users in real-time (if implemented)
-   Play back your composition and export it in various formats

## Module Interactions

The main components of the application interact as follows:

1. **NotationEditor:** Central component for displaying and editing musical notation. Interacts with
   VexFlow for rendering and the Web Audio API for playback.

2. **InstrumentLibrary:** Manages the available virtual instruments. Interacts with Tone.js for
   sound synthesis and the Web Audio API for audio output.

3. **ChordProgression:** Generates chord progressions based on user input or algorithmic
   suggestions. Interacts with the NotationEditor to display the generated chords.

4. **MelodySuggestion:** Provides melody ideas based on the current composition. Interacts with the
   NotationEditor to display suggested melodies.

These components are orchestrated by the main App component, which handles routing and overall
application state.

## Development

The project uses the following development tools:

-   **ESLint** for code linting
-   **Prettier** for code formatting

To run the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

To format the code:

```
npm run format
```
